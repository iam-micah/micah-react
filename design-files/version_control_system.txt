### Branch Naming Conventions:

1. **Main Branch:**
   - `main`

2. **Feature Branches:**
   - `feature/{feature-name}`: For developing new features. 
   Example: `feature/user-authentication`.

3. **Bugfix Branches:**
   - `bugfix/{bug-description}`: For fixing specific bugs. Example: `bugfix/login-page-error`.

4. **Hotfix Branches:**
   - `hotfix/{issue-description}`: For urgent fixes in production. Example: `hotfix/security-patch`.

5. **Release Branches:**
   - `release/{version-number}`: Prepare for a new release. Example: `release/v1.0.0`.

### Workflow:

1. **Start from Main:**
   - Always create feature branches from the `main` branch.

2. **Feature Development:**
   - Create a feature branch for each new feature or task.
   - Work on the feature branch, and regularly merge changes from `main` to keep it up to date.
   - Once the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it back into `main`.

4. **Bugfixing:**
   - For bug fixes, create a branch from `main`, fix the bug, and create a pull request for merging back into `main`.

5. **Hotfixes:**
   - In case of urgent production fixes, create a branch from `main`, fix the issue, and create a pull request. Also, merge these changes back into the `main` and `develop` branches if applicable.

6. **Releases:**
   - When preparing for a release, create a release branch from `main`.
   - Perform necessary testing on the release branch.
   - Once ready, merge the release branch into `main` for deployment.

### Pushing Code:

1. **Pushing Feature Branches:**
   - Push feature branches to the remote repository regularly.

2. **Pull Requests:**
   - Open pull requests for code review before merging changes into the `main` branch.

3. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Integrate continuous integration tools to automate testing on feature branches and pull requests.

4. **Version Tagging:**
   - Tag releases with version numbers. For example, use Git tags like `v1.0.0` for releases.

### Example Workflow:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Work on the feature branch, make commits

# Push changes to remote repository
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create a pull request for code review
# After approval, merge the feature branch into main
```
