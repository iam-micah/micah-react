## Description

This is a personal website built with React. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my projects and skills in web development. The website features a clean, user-friendly design with responsive layouts for different screen sizes. It includes sections for about me, my skills, my projects, and a contact form. The project uses modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and CSS for styling. The website dynamically updates different fields using data values from Google sheets
